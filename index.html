        <h2>WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT</h2>
        <div id="importance">
          <p>
            Stonehenge is the world's best-known ancient stone circle, lying at
            the heart of one of the richest archaeological landscapes in Europe.
            Built around the same time as the Great Pyramid in Egypt, 4,500
            years ago, the finished monument of massive and finely dressed
            sarsen stone was unlike anything ever seen across Europe. It is a
            powerful memorial to a key period of British and European history, a
            time of transformations when landscape was being monumentalised in
            completely new ways as part of communities' changing relationships
            with the land. For centuries, historians and archaeologists have
            puzzled over the many mysteries of Stonehenge, the prehistoric
            monument that took Neolithic builders an estimated 1,500 years to
            erect. Located in southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100
            massive upright stones placed in a circular layout.

        <div id="history">
            <p>
              Archaeologists believe that Stonehenge was constructed from around
              3000 BC to 2000 BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch,
              which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been
              dated to about 3100 BC. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the first
              bluestones were raised between 2400 and 2200 BC, although they may
              have been at the site as early as 3000 BC. One of the most famous
              landmarks in the United Kingdom, Stonehenge is regarded as a
              British cultural icon. It has been a legally protected scheduled
              monument since 1882, when legislation to protect historic
              monuments was first successfully introduced in Britain. The site
              and its surroundings were added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage
              Sites in 1986. Stonehenge is owned by the Crown and managed by
              English Heritage; the surrounding land is owned by the National
              Trust.

        <h2>ARCHAEOLOGY AND MEANING</h2>
        <div id="archaeology">
          <p>
            Stonehenge has often been at the forefront of the development of
            archaeology. Our understanding of the monument is still changing as
            excavations and modern archaeological techniques continue to yield
            more information. Stonehenge has perhaps been the focus of more
            theories about its origin and purpose than any other prehistoric
            monument. Today, the interpretation which is most generally accepted
            is that of a prehistoric temple aligned with the movements of the
            sun. It is the most striking example of the ceremonial complexes
            emerging across Britain and Ireland at this time. These were places
            to honour the ancestors and mark important moments in the calendar.
            At the centre of this belief system was the sun, with the solstice
            alignments enshrined within the fabric of the monument. Stonehenge
            was not 'one' monument, but rather was built, altered, and revered
            for over 1,500 years, around 100 generations.
