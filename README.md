# Stonehenge
This is an informative website I've created based on Stonehenge. 
I created it to help inform viewers about general knowledge of Stonehenge and the events they hold throughout the year.
There's a gallery page for images aswell as a signup page for viewers to recieve any news updates.

#__Navigation Bar__

- Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Event page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

In the main page there's three main sections such as 'Importance, History and Archaeology.

- Importance is general information about why Stonehenge is so important and why it is a key feature to British culture.
- History is about when Stonehenge was built and how long it took to build.
- Archaeology is about how Stonehenge was created and how even to this day it is still worked on and studied.

#__The Footer__

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Stonehenge on Facebook and Instagram. 
- The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
- I also added a hover function that turns a light green (the same green used on my hero text box)
- The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media

- THE MYSTERY OF THE STONES - is a Sherlock themed event is a fun pop-up play, that takes place at Stonehenge Centre.
- FESTIVAL OF NEOLITHIC IDEAS - is a hands-on activity with demonstrations, talks and tours, led by experts in the field.

#__Features Left to Implement__

I have plenty of ideas I would love to create into the website such as;
- A conspiracy page.
- More detail into the history and general information about Stonehenge.
- More social links and social media.

#__Testing__

I've tested my Stonehenge website on multiple browers such as Firefox/Chrome and Microsoft edge. Aswell as my android phone "Samsung internet".
To my current knowledge there are no bugs on any device or internet browser - although I'm still yet to test fully on an ipad/tablet.
The full website is adaptable to all devices and screen sizes.
I believe any of my website consumers will be happy and have a great experience and achieve their goals easily.
I did have a bug with my footer's links not opening correctly on a new page but since has been fixed.


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

The only potential "bug" I currently have is a "warning" for incorrect use of headers in correct correlation. I've changed them multiple times and can't fix the issue. Although it's only a warning I'd still like to fix it correctly.

## Credits

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
